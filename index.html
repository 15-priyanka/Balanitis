<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Balanitis</h1>
<h3><marquee>Balanitis happens when the head of your penis becomes irritated and inflamed.</marquee></h3>
<img src="im.jpg" class="Image">



<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>Causes of balanitis include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>allergic reaction to latex condoms and spermicides.</li>
     <li>allergic reaction to certain medications, including some antibiotics and pain relievers.</li>
<li>sexually transmitted infections (STIs), like gonorrhea and trichomoniasis.</li>
<li>scabies, which is an infestation of tiny skin mites</li>
<li>certain medical conditions, including diabetes and reactive arthritis.</li>
<li>injuries on the tip of the penis or foreskin.</li>
</ul>

	<h3 class="third">SYMPTOMS</h3>
<p>Depending on the cause, balanitis might also cause:</p>
<ul>
	<li>soreness, pain, and irritation around the glans.</li>
<li>tight, shiny foreskin.</li>
<li>itching on the skin of the glans
unusual penile discharge.</li>
<li>sores on the head of the penis.</li>
<li>a thick, white discharge under the foreskin (smegma)
a foul smell from the penis.</li>
<li>painful urination.</li>
<li>swollen groin lymph nodes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>
<p>Test can include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a swab of your urethral opening to check for STIs and other infections.</li>
	<li>urinalysis to check for signs of infection or diabetes.</li>
	<li>blood tests to check for signs of infections, diabetes, and other conditions.</li>
	<li>a skin scraping sample to examine for mites under a microscope</li>
</ul>

	<h3 class="third">TREATMENTS</h3>
<p>Balanitis treatment usually begins with improving your genital hygiene by washing and drying under the foreskin and avoiding the use of hygiene products that contain potential irritants, like perfumes.</p>
<p>If caused by an allergic reaction to certain products or medications, your clinician can help you find suitable alternatives. For instance, different types of medication or latex-free and spermicide-free barrier methods.</p>
<p>Other treatments can be used to help relieve the inflammation and treat the underlying cause. This might include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Antifungal creams: Creams, such as clotrimazole or miconazole, might be prescribed if the inflammation is caused by a yeast infection.</li>
	<li>Anti-itch creams: Over-the-counter and prescription anti-itch creams can help with itching and redness.</li>
	<li>Steroid creams: Creams containing corticosteroids can help relieve inflammation and itching.</li>
	<li>Antibiotics: If caused by an STI, antibiotics may be prescribed. The type of antibiotic and duration will depend on which STI you have.</li>
	<li>Diabetes treatment: If you have diabetes, your clinician will recommend a treatment plan to manage it. This usually involves a combination of medication and lifestyle modifications to control your blood sugar.</li>
	<li>Circumcision: If you develop recurrent balanitis symptoms or phimosis, a clinician might recommend circumcision to remove the foreskin and prevent future symptoms and complications.</li>
</ul>
